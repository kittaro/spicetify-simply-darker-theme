# Simply darker!
Very lightweight theme
_**NOW** - with cool lyrics_ üòº (thanks for idea: 'Better Lyrics style' snippet)

Default font + bring back gradients! Accent is now again Spotify green, you can always change it via marketplace theme editor :|

### _And little more_
Some strings commented out in `user.css`: *remove gradients?* *change font?* or maybe *center lyrics?* or even *hide ugly background under window control buttons?* - **Do it!**
